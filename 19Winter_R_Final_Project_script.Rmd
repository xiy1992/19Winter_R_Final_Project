## In order to see interactive plot (1 & 3) in the Plots panel, please
## 1. click on the gear sign next to Knit in the editor toolbar
## 2. Click "Chunk Output in Console" from the list to check it (if it is not already checked)
## 3. Click on the gear sign to the upper left of the plot in the Plots panel
## 4. Click on the manipulator. Have fun!

#BC: This is such a fascinating graph! I have never heard of the {manipulate} package, but your graph has totally inspired me to try it out! I don't have much to comment on here, because Bayesian statistics pretty much goes over my head. But a couple suggestions might be to add a title to your plot and simplify the axis labels. You could also perhaps add a caption that summarizes the instructions for interacting with the graph. I am still a novice at writing functions, so I learned a lot from looking through your first chunk of code.

```{r Plot 2, 3D plot}
# make a colored 3Dplot with alpha = .05, pH1 = .8
x<-seq(0, 1, 0.1)
y<-seq(0, 1, 0.1)
BayesRatioModelSet <- function(x, beta, alpha=.05, pH1=.8, print = TRUE){
  a <- dbinom(x*10, 10, prob = alpha) 
  #a <- p (these results | H0 true)
  b <- dbinom(x*10, 10, prob = beta)
  #b <- p (these results | H1 true)
  c <- b/a*pH1/(1-pH1)
  #c <- Bayes Theorem odds ratio of H1:H0
  return(log10(c+1))}
z = outer(x,y,BayesRatioModelSet)
# Surface colours corresponding to z-values
nrz <- nrow(z)
ncz <- ncol(z)
jet.colors <- colorRampPalette( c("blue", "green")) #BC: This is such a cool function! Seems really useful for using color with continuous variables. 
nbcol <- 100
color <- jet.colors(nbcol)
zfacet <- z[-1, -1] + z[-1, -ncz] + z[-nrz, -1] + z[-nrz, -ncz]
facetcol <- cut(zfacet, nbcol) 
persp(x, y, z, col = color[facetcol],
      xlab = "power",
      ylab = "proportion",
      zlab = "Log10(BayesRatio+1)",
      main = "BayesRatioDependingonProportionPowerAlphapH1",
      theta=30,phi=30,ticktype="detailed",
      d = 1)

#BC: This is so cool! I think this is a really effective 3D visualization. I'm not exactly sure what the color scale refers to, however--is there a legend you could include that would explain this? 
```

```{r Plot 3, interactive 3D plot}
x<-seq(0, 1, 0.1)
y<-seq(0, 1, 0.1)
BayesRatioModel <- function(x, beta, alpha, pH1, print = TRUE){
  a <- dbinom(x*10, 10, prob = alpha) 
  #a <- p (these results | H0 true)
  b <- dbinom(x*10, 10, prob = beta)
  #b <- p (these results | H1 true)
  c <- b/a*pH1/(1-pH1)
  #c <- Bayes Theorem odds ratio of H1:H0
  return(log10(c+1))}

interactive2<-manipulate(persp(x,y,outer(x,y,BayesRatioModel,alpha, pH1),
                               xlab = "power",
                               ylab = "proportion",
                               zlab = "Log10(BayesRatio+1)",
                               shade = .1,
                               main = "BayesRatioDependingonProportionPowerAlphapH1",
                               theta=30,phi=30,ticktype="detailed",
                               d = 1), 
                         pH1=slider(.1, .9, step=.1, initial =.8),
                         alpha = picker(.001, .01, .05, .1))

#BC: Again, so cool! Would it be possible to add color to this graph like your last, static one? Maybe the color scale could change as you tweak the input parameters? Also, I noticed that as you change the inputs, the y axis scale changes a bit. You might not actually want this to happen, but maybe having the axis stay the same as you change the inputs would result in a more dramtic visual change in the graph?
