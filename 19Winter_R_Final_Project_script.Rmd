## In order to see interactive plot (1 & 3) in the Plots panel, please
## 1. click on the gear sign next to Knit in the editor toolbar
## 2. Click "Chunk Output in Console" from the list to check it (if it is not already checked)
## 3. Click on the gear sign to the upper left of the plot in the Plots panel
## 4. Click on the manipulator. Have fun!

# Hi Xi,

# Wow, very cool interactive visualizations. Very interesting paper idea and very important topic to take on. I am impressed!

# The following are things that I see as strenghts in your code and visualizations:
# - The interactiveness is a major strenght. It was really cool to see how changing the variables made the plane move! 
# - Conveying complex ideas with your visualization.
# - Colors in plot #2 makes you visualization more attractive. 

# From your script I learned an alternative way to produce visualizations. I bet you have done a lot of research outside of class! 

# Suggestion: You are probably aware of this, but you may want to find out how to add spaces between the values on the axes and their titles so they don't overlap. 
# Also, I wanted to let you know that for some reason, the code that is within this {} did not running for me.

# I hope I helped with the YAML thing. I am sorry that I don't know how to help you with the highlighting part. 

# # Impressive work you have done so far!

```
